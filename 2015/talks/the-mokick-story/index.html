In his talk, Markus will give you a sneak preview on the current development status of MOKICK. The vision behind MOKICK is to create an offline content management system and authoring tool which provides an easy and unified way for creating content of any kind - usable everywhere. Heâ€™ll show you the basic concept of the underlying graph based data model, how the editor (OpenFL) creates his views based on project specific data rule sets and content, how the PureMVC layer enables easy batch task implementation and how all this applies to a real world project. He will further give you a brief introduction what occurrences and experiences during a long history of project developments finally led to the decision of rethinking everything, why his company now uses Haxe and what the future plans for this project are.
