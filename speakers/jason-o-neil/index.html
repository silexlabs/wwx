title: Lead Programmer at Sheridan Research Institute and founder of Today We Learned
---

Jason uses Haxe to make web apps for the education market. After going "full time" with Haxe in 2013, Jason built the Sheridan School Management System for a network of Australian schools using Haxe and Ufront. More recently, he founded Today We Learned, an app that guides teachers in a 60 second update to send to parents - and participated in Perth's first ever seed funded start-up accelerator. In the Haxe ecosystem Jason is known for his work on Ufront, the Haxe website and Haxelib, as well as spending far too long answering questions on Stack Overflow. When he's not programming in Haxe he's probably asleep, dreaming of macros within macros.
