When you will need to program UIs in Haxe, then you might need a Cocktail !

With one code base you will be able to manipulate the DOM and deploy liquid layouts on all platforms supported by haXe. Cocktail is also a good complement of NME.

Since the announcement of an abstraction layer last year, we have released the first version of this haXe library, and we have a better understanding of where we want to go. We will enjoy talking about our goals, strategy and progress.
