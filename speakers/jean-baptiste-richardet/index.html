Jean-Baptiste has been from back to front to back again since 2011, and always liked discovering and playing with various language. When he discovered Haxe in 2012, it was love at first sight! Since, Jb tried to give its best to the community by helping and creating some libraries, and raise awareness around Haxe with Silex Labs.
