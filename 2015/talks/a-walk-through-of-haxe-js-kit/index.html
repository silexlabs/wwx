I will demonstrate the main features of Haxe JS Kit, and through them, the huge benefits of using Haxe over alternatives such as Typescript to "just" target Javascript. This will include miscellaneous sexy stuff, from MongoDB modelling to ReactJS integration, isomorphism, NPM integration, and more generally, ways to quickly build solid full stack applications.
