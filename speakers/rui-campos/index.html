Rui is a Game Developer from Portugal. He started his gamedev career at Miniclip and has been at GameDuell since 2013. During his studies at University of Porto he used to experiment with Natural User Interfaces, especially large horizontal displays (e.g. Microsoft Surface) and Kinect. At GameDuell he has been working on a cross-platform game development workflow that involves a completely new build system, a dependency manager and a game engine all written, of course, in Haxe!
