Elliott’s talk will focus on his current personal passion; the development of his TARDIS Go -> Haxe project and the potential re-use of Go libraries in Haxe. With examples ranging from Unicode normalisation to image inspection, he can promise you probably the only talk with speaking-in-tongues and nudity (not him).
