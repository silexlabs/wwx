This talk is mainly about Jive. It’s a cross-platform UI based on AsWing, and explain to you where it comes from and go to. The second part is about Nickolay's opinions about UI librairies : why it’s important for a community and what features it should have. Finally, he'll do a small comparaison of HaxeUI, StablexUI and Jive.
