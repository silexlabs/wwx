__WWX2015?__

<br />

Do you like Haxe, the WWX and the world of open source? Your help is always welcome!

<br />

We are looking for new ways to fund the Haxe conference next year because we did not find enough sponsors this year. We are open to your suggestions to enable us to continue to organize this event, which seems so important to the Haxe community.

<br />

__Special thanks__

<br />

To organize this conference Silex Labs has united its members
most motivated by Haxe to form a working group:
the THaxe Force includes among its members the President
of Silex Labs, [Alex Hoyau](https://twitter.com/lexoyo), co-founder [Pol Goasdoué](https://twitter.com/superwup) and a
whole lot of Haxe developers like [Clément Charmet](https://twitter.com/clemenchar),
[Yannick Dominguez](https://github.com/yanhick), [Jean-Baptiste Richardet](https://twitter.com/JbIPS), 
[Jean-Michel Delettre](https://twitter.com/flashline_net), [Thomas Fétiveau](https://twitter.com/zab0jad) and 
[Ariel Sommeria Klein](https://twitter.com/arielsom). These volunteers have donated their
time to prepare for this conference, and this since
October 2013. Antonin Stephany, an employee of the
association hosted the working group to ensure that
this swarm of ideas was put to good use.

<br />

Our thanks goes out to the speakers and all the participants for their motivation and collaboration!
