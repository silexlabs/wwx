Dear members, dear Haxe family,

<br />

We are happy and proud to be in charge of the organization of the new Worldwide Haxe conference
which will take place in Paris from May 24th to May 27th 2013. As last year Silex Labs wants
to organize this event in a good mood of friendship and serious work on innovative technology,
and as last year we have the chance to have great speakers for this event. (the speakers’ list
is available on the [wwx2013 website]({{ site.baseurl }}/2013/speakers/)

<br />

We hope that you will be as motivated as we are to be an active member of this community in
order to make this event a success, we really need you for our haxe family so [register now](http://wwx2013.eventbrite.fr/).
