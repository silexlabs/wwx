title: Developer at <a href="http://prezi.com/">Prezi</a>

Lorant has been a software developer for more than twelve years. His most recent project at Prezi forced him out of his comfort zone of enterprise Java development, and pushed him over to the client side. This new challenge involves many platforms, dozens of languages (including both human and computer dialects, Haxe among them), and the rekindling of his love affair with typography.
