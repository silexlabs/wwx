In this talk, Todd and Gabe Dalbec, Principal Engineer at TiVo, discuss the process and experience TiVo had in converting its set-top box user interface from AS3 to Haxe.  They discuss how TiVo evaluated and eventually selected Haxe as their technology foundation for future products’ user experiences.

Over one million lines of AS3 product code and tests were (mostly) programmatically converted to Haxe.  The challenges that TiVo encountered during the conversion are discussed along with lessons learned and TiVo’s ideas for future directions for the Haxe language and its accompanying tools and haxelibs.  Finally, Todd and Gabe demo the latest TiVo Haxe DVR user interface on a range of different devices.
