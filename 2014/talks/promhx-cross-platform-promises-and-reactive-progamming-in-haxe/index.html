Promises and reactive programming are emerging as a way of managing complex asynchronous information flow while avoiding io blocks. This talk focuses on the nature and history of promises/reactive programming, and how Promhx brings these concepts together into a single framework. From managing asynchronous initialization steps, to providing ui interactions, to scheduling thread-bound workflows, Promhx provides an expressive way of managing the variety of issues that are common to single threaded, asynchronous application development.
