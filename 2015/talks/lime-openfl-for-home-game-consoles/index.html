Traditionally, developers wanting to port a PC game to consoles would hire a dedicated team to re-write the game for that platform, usually costing tens of thousands of dollars, minimum. Why can't it be as easy as exporting your existing Haxe app to mac or linux? Let's fix that. We'll share how we solved both the technical and the legal challenges of this undertaking, as well as our plans for making the new OpenFL console targets widely available. This talk should be of primary interest to Lime and OpenFL users who want to publish games or apps for consoles and handhelds, but will also have valuable information for users and developers of other Haxe frameworks who want to add console compatibility. Time and circumstances permitting, we'll also demonstrate our current progress with one or two OpenFL games that use the console technology*, Yummy Circus and Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten (HD special edition).
