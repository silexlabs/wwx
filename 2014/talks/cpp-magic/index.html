Have you every wanted to see a back-end split open and spill its guts Tauntaun style? Well, this just might be for you. This talk will cover some of the strange and wonderful features the C++ back-end has to offer. These include how to make the build-system work for you, how to mess with the generated code and how in integrate it with other native systems. Future directions of the back-end will also be discussed.
