This talk takes a tour though the current state and future directions of the hxcpp target. There are been quite a few juicy changes in the C++ backend over the past year. With tighter native integration for the more nerdy developer and better scripting integration for the not-quite-so-nerdy developer, there should be something in talk for everyone.
