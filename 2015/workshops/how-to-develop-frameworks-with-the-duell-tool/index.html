title: How to develop frameworks with the duell tool
authors: ["Sven Otto", "Rui Campos"]

Workshop from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm
<br /><br />
The Duell Tool is a command line tool for setting up, building and running applications on any platform. It can also be used for other general tasks within app development. It is made in a modular way via plugins, and each plugin is separate from the tool itself. The tool merges the needed plugin on execution. The Duell Tool will be presented at the World Wide Haxe Conference in Paris on saturday at 11:20 am UTC+2.
<br /><br />
For this workshop, Sven Otto and Rui Campos from GameDuell will show how to build and extend your own engine with the Duell Tool and their (open sourced) standard libraries.
<br /><br />
They will create a simple sound library as an example in the workshop, letting people contribute to different target platforms which should show how development works in a team with the Duell Tool.
<br /><br />
Based on the number of participants we could also write another library in parallel.
<br /><br />
Audience: Framework/Engine Developers
<br /><br />
Notes: Participants have a Github account and admin rights on their own machine. Preferably Mac computers.
