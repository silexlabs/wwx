Andreas has been working on larger web systems and applications for about 10 years, specializing in system integration and architecture. He worked from start to finish as lead designer and programmer in multiple e-commerce, banking and large-scale social communication systems.

He started using Haxe at early version 2, created the web framework Haxigniter, then some mocking/DI libraries followed by ufront and its template engine erazor, together with Franco Ponticelli. He has been working the last year on a Design by Contract and a DCI library, since Haxe has currently one of the best possibilities to realize the new architectural paradigm DCI (Data, Context, Interaction).
