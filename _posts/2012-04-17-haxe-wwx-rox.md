It was awesome! And it’s over. We should do it again
</div>
<br />

The WWX Haxe conference just finished. [Silex Labs](http://silexlabs.org/silexlabs/) is very proud to have organized it,
as it gave us the opportunity to bring together wonderful people from all over the world to talk about one of our
favourite subjects: [Haxe](http://haxe.org/).

<br />

The conference was sold out, so it goes to show that Haxe has incredible momentum. There were people from France of
course, and also Australia, New Zealand, USA, Brazil, Canada, Hungary, Germany, Netherlands, UK, and Italy. The variety
of applications they are working on with Haxe was equally mind blowing:  web, mobile, games, artistic installations,
presentation software.

<br />

You would have thought it was only about code. You would have been wrong! There were presentations about business,
marketing, and art, all with a Haxe twist. And yes, lots and lots of code. Silex Labs and the Haxe community would
like to thank the people who put in the time and energy to make such good presentations. [Please check them out here]({{ site.baseurl }}/2012/speakers/)
and stay tuned because we will release pictures, the videos and the slides soon – [Silex Labs on twitter](https://twitter.com/silexlabs),
[on facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/143614919006712/) and [Silex Labs blog](http://www.silexlabs.org/category/the-blog/blog-silex-labs/).

<br />

Of course, a good presentation needs an audience, and we would like to thank the people who attended for listening,
supporting the speakers and interacting with them. There were many conversations that sparked great ideas that would
never have come to light without the social mix that only happens at a conference.

<br />

We also needed to let off steam and get the creative juices flowing, so we had a great Saturday night at the
Bistrot Marguerite, who ran a private party for us with drinks and « Verrines de Boeuf Bourguignon ». For geek
cred we could play video games projected on the ceiling while we danced.

Thank you finally to our sponsors and everyone who helped out. We’re happy and exhausted. See you all next year!
