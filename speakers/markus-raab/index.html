Markus is a senior ActionScript developer and created games, websites, e-learning modules, business applications, installations and whatever you can think of during the last 15 years. Heâ€™s really into creating application frameworks and loves diving into the Haxe world, which incidentally gives him the opportunity to tackle even bigger JavaScript projects without worrying about code maintenance. Don't forget to check his <a href="http://blog.derraab.com/">blog</a>! Oh, and he loves <a href="http://facebook.com/derRaab.music">DJing</a>!
