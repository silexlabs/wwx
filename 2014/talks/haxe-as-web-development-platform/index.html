Haxe is one of the most undervalued programming languages, it is a flexible and modern typed language, which can probably be best characterized as a cross-platform casual game development platform. But is it all it can ever be? It compiles to Javascript. It is more powerful than Coffeescript and EcmaScript 6. It is more mature than TypeScript. It interoperates with native Javascript better than Dart. What does it take to be a web development platform, and can Haxe become one? Does it want to become one?
