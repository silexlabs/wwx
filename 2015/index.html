<h2>Crowdfunding</h2>
<p>
	<img style="float: right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2015/ulule-successfully-funded.png" alt="We are founded" />
	
	In spite of the hard work of the volunteers of Silex Labs and the Haxe community we still need some funding
	in order to organize a professional event well deserved by the Haxe Community (communication, video, food).
	We hope that you will be as motivated as we are to be an active member of this community. In order to make
	this event a success, we really need you for our haxe family so help us by taking part in the crowdfunding.
	
	<br /><br />
	EDIT: We're funded!
