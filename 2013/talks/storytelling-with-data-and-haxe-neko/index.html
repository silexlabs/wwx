The main goal of data visualization is its ability to communicate information clearly and effectively. Despite the “big data” effort, a lot of interesting resource is not available through an API, but distributed as files (json, xml, csv, excel…). What can you do when a file exceed 10 GigaBytes or when you have to deal with complex spreadsheets. How can you quickly dig into your content and make sure that it contains relevant information? Because of it’s amazing speed on reading, processing and writing text based files, Haxe/Neko is of great assistance to do this preliminary job. In my session, I will show you how I used Haxe/Neko to extract relevant data and prepare essential resources for my data­visualizations.
