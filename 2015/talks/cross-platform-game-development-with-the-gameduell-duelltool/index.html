Sven Otto and Rui Campos will introduce GameDuell’s custom Haxe tool for the first time in public. The DuellTool provides a configurable build system, dependency resolution and a versatile developer environment setup. It was developed from scratch by the Berlin-based game developer’s team within the last year to cater the cross-platform development of casual games for the Facebook, iOS and Android platforms. The two developers will present how the tool gives platform specialists a handy workflow to seamlessly contribute to the same API’s. Further, they will share their approach for the modularity of libraries and how they defined the platform abstraction layer to provide an efficient and maintainable development process.
