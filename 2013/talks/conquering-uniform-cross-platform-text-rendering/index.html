Our product at Prezi is a presentation tool that needs to show presentations in exactly the same way on a growing number of platforms and devices. Prezi is all about zooming, so even the slightest differences are enlarged. Of the parts that make up a presentation, text is the hardest to get right: each platform has itâ€™s slightly different way of displaying text. So we decided to roll our own solution, with Haxe at its core. We had to add some other things, like JavaScript and C++ to the mix as well. Come and see how all this fit together in the Prezi text rendering engine.
