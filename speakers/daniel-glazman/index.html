title: aka <a href="https://twitter.com/glazou">@glazou</a> - CEO of Disruptive Innovations and W3C CSS WG Co-chairman

Daniel is a dinosaur of Web Standards and is at the root of the semi-official trouble-making unit at W3C, the "glazou" (a 1glazou rant being kind of a storm). Being one of the only survivors to 12 years of CSS standardization, he was appointed Co-chairman of the CSS Working Group in 2008. Newcomer to Haxe, he sees it as a potential ubiquitous programmer's dream going far beyond the Gaming industry. You can follow his <a href="http://glazman.org/weblog">blog</a> to learn more.
