Workshop from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm<br />
<br />
Jason and Juraj will be putting together a macro workshop during the Monday session at the WWX, to shine a light into this realm of dark magic!<br />
They'll be starting with a beginner friendly introduction and then build up to more complex examples, giving you both an entry point and an overview for this topic.
There will be a second part, in which we’d like you to bring in real world issues, such as:
<ul>
    <li>things you think should be doable with macros, but you just can’t figure out how</li>
    <li>code you have that is clunky, bloated, inelegant, relies far too much on reflection or is otherwise speckled with costly runtime checks that should actually be doable at compile time</li>
    <li>tedious stuff that you see yourself doing again and again, but that you just cannot build a reusable tool for by means of other language features</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Whether you are having trouble to get started with macros, or there are specific parts you cannot wrap your head around, or you just want to deepen your knowledge, or of course if you’d like to see life coding go horribly wrong (can’t promise anything, but Murphy’s law is definitely on our side here), come join us on Monday – we will make it worth your time!
