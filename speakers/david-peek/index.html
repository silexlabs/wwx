title: UI Engineering Architect at <a href="http://massiveinteractive.com/">Massive</a>

Jack of all trades, master of some, David is a chronic experimenter. Weened onto programming by the gradual introduction of scripting to the Flash Player, he now works in HaXe, AS3, JavaScript, C++, Ruby and the occasional bash script. Definitely a right brain developer, he knew about easing long before he knew about encapsulation. Heâ€™s been building UI frameworks since before it was cool. David oversees the software architecture, implementation and developer workflow for the Massivision UI Framework and is responsible for a number of open source Haxe projects including RobotHaxe and HXSignals.
