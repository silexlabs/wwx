Juraj has been around the Haxe community for a while now. A former flasher, now a devoted Haxer, he likes pushing the language to its limits, to annoy the compiler team to get new funky features and hang around our Google Group to help as best he can and to argue passionately in the countless discussions we have. And he still hasnâ€™t learnt to write biographies. No macro for that just yet.
