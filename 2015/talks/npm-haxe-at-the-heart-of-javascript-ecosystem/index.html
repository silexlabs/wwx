Javascript ecosystem for web app development is well implanted and NPM is at the centre of it. Coffeescript and Typescript are perfectly integrated and have offered a real alternative to full Javascript development. For almost a year now, Haxe has constituted a third alternative in this ecosystem. We will look at why Haxe is a very relevant option. We will introduce its current state of integration, fonctionning and evolutions to come.
