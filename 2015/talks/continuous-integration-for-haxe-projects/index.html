If there is anything more horrible than having bugs, it would be introducing more bugs without noticing. In this talk, I will present how to set up continuous integration (CI) services, like TravisCI and AppVeyor, to automatically test our Haxe code for every commit. I will also discuss some interesting use of CI that could be useful no matter we are building games, mobile apps, websites, or writing novels.
