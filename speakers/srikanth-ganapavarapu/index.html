Much of his career starting 1996, Srikanth enjoyed leading efforts and being hands-on in solving large scale scalability challenges. Currently at TiVo, Srikanth is excited to be part of the team that works hard at improving performance of the UI application that has to compete for resources with higher priority programs on a versatile embedded device. Srikanth was introduced to Haxe in winter 2012. Since then, itâ€™s been a wonderful ride of learning, adapting, and contributing. For him, Haxe holds the promise of many possibilities and excitement in treading uncharted waters.
