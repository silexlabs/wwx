Peter is working on phasing out the Flash codebase of Prezi for years using Haxe. Along the way he worked with Haxe code compiled to Javascript running in Webkit embedded in Objective-C, and Haxe code compiled to SWC running in Adobe AIR talking with itself compiled to JS running in a C++ AIR native extension. Recently he’s focusing with his team on targeting Web with Haxe.
