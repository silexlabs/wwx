In this talk, TiVo will present a quick update on its experiences using Haxe for user interface development on set-top box and mobile devices. We will cover the challenges experienced and lessons learned in such areas as performance measurement, API "cheating" for performance, memory leak tooling, and memory churn optimization. We will also briefly discuss the consumer reception of our Haxe-based releases and share some consumer satisfaction metrics. We hope that sharing our experiences will inspire others and facilitate collaboration on these and similar issues in the future.
