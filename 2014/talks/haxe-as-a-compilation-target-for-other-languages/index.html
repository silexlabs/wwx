I will recount my experiences developing a Go->Haxe transpiler (Code source on github). I will explain the good, the bad, and the ugly of using Haxe as the intermediate language in a compilation chain. I will signpost how others could use Haxe in the same way, and suggest how the language might be improved to make that type of use easier. At the end, I will ask for help to improve the TARDISgo project!
