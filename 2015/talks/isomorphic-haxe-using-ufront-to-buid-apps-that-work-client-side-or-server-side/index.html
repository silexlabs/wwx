Most web frameworks do their work on either the client or server. But most web-apps need a combination: server side rendering is great for a fast first page load, backward compatibility and search engine optimisation. And client side rendering makes the rest of the page loads feel instant, like a native app. Jason will show how Haxe and Ufront let you get the best of both worlds.
