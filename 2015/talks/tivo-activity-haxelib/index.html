In this talk, TiVo will present the conceptual design of its activity haxelib. The activity API provides an event-driven programming paradigm with asynchronous triggers allowing multiple coordinated contexts of execution within a single program. In addition, the activity API allows increased performance on some platforms via the use of multiple threads while falling back gracefully to single threaded execution on platforms which do not; all without requiring any target specific code. This talk will present APIs allowing the creation of and communication between activities. It will also provide examples of how the activities paradigm can enable the ability to mix multiple, previously incompatible or difficult to combine haxelibs within one program.
