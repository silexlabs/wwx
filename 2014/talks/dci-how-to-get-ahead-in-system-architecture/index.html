This talk will focus on the foundation and importance of a solid architecture, explaining the problem with today's so-called object-orientation and why most systems ends up being overly complicated and hard to comprehend. It will show how to create a truly people-oriented domain model, mapping end-user mental models directly to code, and how to avoid complicating system design by separating data from function, two concepts with very different rate of change. The DCI paradigm is rooted in timeless design principles with a solid theoretical foundation, and introduces for the first time system behavior as a first class entity in computer software.
