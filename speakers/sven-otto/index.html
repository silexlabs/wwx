Sven admires programming since his youth and occasionally digested books introducing C/C++, Objective-C or 3D Games with DirectX. Several years later he studied computer science in Berlin and released three iOS games as an indie game developer. He started working at GameDuell in 2012, where he developed an iOS game engine which is used in the French card game belote.com. Currently, he is working on a cross-platform game engine which targets iOS, Android, HTML5 and Flash, of course built with Haxe.
